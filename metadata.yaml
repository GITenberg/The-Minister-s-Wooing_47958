description: Mary Scudder lives with her widowed mother in a modest middle-class home.
  Dr. Hopkins, a Calvinist minister who boards with them, is dedicated to helping
  the slaves arriving at Newport and calls for the abolition of slavery. The pious
  Mary admires him but is also in love with the passionate but skeptical James Marvyn
  who, hungry for adventure, joins the crew of a ship setting sail for exotic destinations.
  When James is presumed lost at sea, Mary fears for his soul, and consents to marry
  the good Doctor. With important insights on slavery, history, and gender, as well
  as characters based on historical figures, it is an attempt through fiction to create
  a moral, intellectual, and affective history for New England.
